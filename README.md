# Chapter-12

In this chapter, I learned how to integrate platform-native code into Flutter apps, enabling seamless communication between Flutter and native Android/iOS functionalities.

I explored platform channels, which allow Flutter to send and receive messages to access platform-specific APIs. I also learned how to write native code in Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android) to interact directly with device features like sensors, battery status, and system information.

Additionally, I discovered how to use MethodChannel to send messages from the Flutter side and how FlutterMethodChannel (iOS) and MethodChannel (Android) handle communication on the host side, processing calls and returning results.

This chapter gave me the skills to extend Flutter's capabilities by integrating native functionality when needed, making apps more powerful and versatile.
